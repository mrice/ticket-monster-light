============

This is to prove that jenkins can wire up to a remote repository and run as a continuous integration server. Had to tweak github repo so that it always works off of master and that the build artifact is that at the top level because of issues I had with openshift.

Next step is to create a job that will let me cut a TEST release (one tagged?).
