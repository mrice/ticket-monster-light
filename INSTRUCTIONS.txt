The following is a list of steps that were needed in order to get the ticket-
monster project deployed in JBoss EAP 6 on top of OpenShift Online.  These
instructions assume you already have an Openshift Online account and can deploy
to medium and large gears
  
1.	Add the JBoss EAP 6 Application in OpenShift Online.
2.	Add the PostgreSQL Cartridge for the JBoss EAP 6 Application.
3.	Clone the JBoss EAP git repo.
4.	Clone this repo (rhc-west/ticket-monster).
5.	You will need to add the following repositories to your MVN settings.xml:
		
		<id>jboss-ga-repository</id>
		<url>http://maven.repository.redhat.com/techpreview/all</url>
		
		<id>jboss-earlyaccess-repository</id>
		<url>http://maven.repository.redhat.com/earlyaccess/all/</url>

6.	Replace '2.6.0-redhat-1' with '2.5.0-redhat-1' in the pom.xml for this 
	project.  Details about steps 4 and 5 can be found here:
	
		https://community.jboss.org/thread/242175

7.	Make sure ticket-monster builds properly with 'mvn -U clean package'.
8.	package a .war file with postgres and openshift support with the following:

		mvn clean package -Ppostgresql-openshift

9.	Copy the target/ticket-monster.war file created (located at 
	<root-of-openshift-application-git-repo>):

		cp target/ticket-monster.war 
			<root-of-openshift-application-git-repo>/deployments/ROOT.war

10.	Navigate to <root-of-openshift-application-git-repos> folder.
11.	Remove the existing src folder and pom.xml file:

		git rm -r src
		git rm pom.xml

12.	Add the copied file to the repository, commit and push to Openshift:

		git add deployments/ROOT.war
		git commit -m "Deploy TicketMonster"
		git push

13.	Now you can see the application running at: 

		http://<app-name>-<domain-name>.rhcloud.com
